    <h1>History of the Island Craft Shop</h1>
    <h2>From modest beginnings</h2>
    <p>It was founded in 1991 by a group of talented Champlain Island crafters including Sue Alenick, Mary Jane Healy and Ethel Schuele
This is a member-owned and operated business. Over the years, the shop has moved several times and members have come and gone, but the Island Craft Shop continues to offer some of the best and most innovative Vermont products.</p>
    
    <h2> Our forever home</h2>
    <p> The shop has grown into a must-see destination for Islanders and visitors alike.  Twenty-one members now exhibit a wide-ranging array of unique crafts, from fiber goods to pottery, fused and stained glass art, jewelry in a variety of styles, turned wooden household items, watercolor and acrylic paintings, candles, garden ornaments and many other made-in-Vermont items. You'll find gift ideas for showers and weddings, birthdays and both adult and children's events.</p>
    <h3>It's a great place to do early Christmas shopping.</h3>
